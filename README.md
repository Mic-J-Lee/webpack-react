# webpack-react

Used this tutorial: https://ditrospecta.com/javascript/react/es6/webpack/2015/07/23/react-flux-hot-load-webpack.html

Which didnt' work.  For me, anyway.  Might be because its more than two years old.  Many commits later, running and deployed to Heroku!  Thanks John for helping me and teaching me so much about webpack!
